# vacation-trip-planner-frontend


The vacation trip planner allows the visitor to create a trip itinerary based on available lodging around the world. There are authentication features that allow the traveler to see the available lodging and add the residence to the trip plan. I would love to travel the world someday and this application is just the catalyst for making that dream come true.


(Ruby on Rails backend, React.js frontend, any libraries, APIs, etc.)

Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application
